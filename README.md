# UControl-Smart-Car-Controlled-via-Android-App

A smart car system controlled through a custom Android application, featuring **Bluetooth connectivity**, **facial recognition login**, and **real-time sensor data monitoring**. This project combines **mobile development**, **embedded systems**, and **machine learning** to create an interactive and secure remote control solution.

## Key Features

### Facial Recognition Login
- Users can register and log in using their face.
- Powered by **TensorFlow Lite** and **cosine similarity** matching.
- Face embeddings are stored securely with **SharedPreferences**.
